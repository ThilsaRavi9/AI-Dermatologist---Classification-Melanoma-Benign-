# AI-Dermatologist---Classification-Melanoma-Benign-
The AI Dermatologist Project uses a deep learning model with CNNs (ResNet and ImageNet) to detect melanoma in skin images. By applying data augmentation and transfer learning, it enhances accuracy, aiming to assist healthcare professionals in early melanoma diagnosis and improving detection reliability.

AI Dermatologist - Melanoma Classification Model
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify skin lesions as benign or malignant (melanoma) using image data. The model is trained using deep learning techniques to assist dermatologists in early melanoma detection and improve diagnostic accuracy.

Model Overview
Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Target Variable: Malignant (Melanoma) vs. Benign
Input: Skin lesion images
Output: Binary classification (Melanoma or Benign)
The model was trained on a publicly available dataset of skin lesion images and utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for model training and evaluation.

Features
High Accuracy: The model achieves high classification accuracy for identifying melanoma.
Efficient: Optimized for fast inference and prediction.
Portable: The model is saved as a .h5 file, making it easy to deploy in different environments.
Installation
Requirements
Before using the model, ensure you have the following dependencies:

Python 3.6 or later
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
OpenCV (for image processing)
You can install the required packages using pip.

Download the Model
The pre-trained model can be downloaded from the Dropbox link below:



After downloading, place the model.keras file in your static directory.

Usage
To use the model, load the pre-trained model and prepare the image you want to classify. The model will output whether the skin lesion is classified as "Malignant" (Melanoma) or "Benign."

Model Performance
The model has been evaluated with the following performance metrics:

Accuracy: 90% (example)
Precision: 88% (example)
Recall: 85% (example)
F1 Score: 86% (example)
